This SudokuSolver is an Android app that allows the user to enter Sudokus into the app, either manually through a button numpad, or through the use of the phone camera and optical character recognition (OCR).
The Sudoku grid can then either be cleared or solved. In addition, a hint for a specific cell can be provided.
